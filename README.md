Using the linked list ADT described in Ch4 “Queue ADT” write a menu-driven user interface to test the
operations in the ADT. Any errors discovered during the processing should be printed as a part of the test
result. A suggested menu is shown below.
A. Enqueue data into queue
B. Dequeue and print data
C. Print data at the front
D. Print data at the rear
E. Print entire queue
F. Print queue status (Empty or Non-empty)
G. Print number of elements
H. Destroy queue and quit
Test your program with the following test cases. You may
include additional test cases after you have executed the tests
shown below.

 Print queue status (F) // should be empty
 Dequeue and print data (B) // should print error
 Enqueue data into queue: 5 (A)
 Enqueue data into queue: 8 (A)
 Print queue status (F)
 Print data at the front (C)
 Print data at the rear (D)
 Print entire queue (E)
 Print number of elements in queue (G)
 Dequeue and print data (B)
 Dequeue and print data (B)
 Dequeue and print data (B) // should print error
 Enqueue data into queue: 14 (A)
 Print data at the front (C)
 Print data at the rear (D)
 Enqueue data into queue: 32 (A)
 Print data at the front (C)
 Print data at the rear (D)
 Destroy quque and quit (H)
